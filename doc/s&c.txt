A two stage has been discussed as a viable approach in the near future. We obviously not intend to strive for sophistication 
at all costs. If a cheap and simple model fulfills 80 percent of customer needs and could be delivered within a relatively, 
that’s already a great feat. Moreover, the learnings of building the simple model will fuel the implementation of a more 
sophisticated model that, hopefully, makes customers 100 percent satisfied.

	Functionalities covered	Deployment / integration implemented 	Business value delivered
Stage 0 (pre-deployment)	Fundamental framework	Implement Shiny 	Showcase
Stage 1			
			Simpliest
Stage 2			
			

Constraints
Unlike in a corporate environment
A team consists of developers, data engineers and data scientist.
•	Funding/resource that support such a team
•	Organization structure that back the running of such a team
•	Data access
•	Business understanding/Business alignment, making sure there is alignment on the goal of the project. 
On top of that, you need to know how the model will be used. What is the expected output? How will the predictions be consumed?
Lack of cross-language and framework support
