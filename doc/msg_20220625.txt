Congratulations on your new freedom. After 70k hours of hard work with the department, you have finally attained this milestone.

Thank you for your support, generosity as well as constantly turning things easier for us across years. The early morning roster 
in the office won’t be the same without you. Our fortnightly video conference will be less colourful in the absence of your 
impressive wall papers.

I genuinely hope you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy family, friends and hobbies as much as we’ve enjoyed having you as 
our team leader & colleague. I wish you the very best of every moment & aspect of your new life.
